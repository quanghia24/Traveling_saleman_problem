## What is the Traveling Salesman Problem?
"The travelling salesman problem, also known as the travelling salesperson problem (TSP),
asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin
city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer
science and operations research" - from Wikipedia.

In some other words, the problem is: given a complete graph with weighted edges (as an
adjacency matrix) what is the the Hamiltonian cycle (path that visits every node once) of
minimum cost?

So lets see how I manage to solve this.
